# Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction
An end-to-end machine learning project that analyzes customer support ticket data to identify key drivers of customer satisfaction and predict satisfaction outcomes using a Random Forest model in R.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer satisfaction levels using machine learning classification models based on customer-related attributes.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior and feedback data
- Build predictive machine learning models
- Compare model performance using evaluation metrics
- Identify key factors influencing customer satisfaction

## Dataset
The dataset consists of customer demographic, behavioral, and service-related variables used for prediction.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Machine Learning
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature Importance analysis

## Results
Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance with improved accuracy and balanced classification results. Key features influencing customer satisfaction were identified.

## Conclusion
